<!-- Introduction -->

<strong>Welcome!</strong> I just made this website with `Jekyll`, an open source static page generator, and I'm hosting it using `GitHub Pages`. All the services I used are 100% <strong>free</strong>. I'm currently using this <a href="https://github.com/naye0ng/Grape-Theme">`grape-theme`</a> with only a few modifications to the original code. You can find my source code <a href="https://github.com/jennieablog/jennieablog.github.io">here</a>.<br><br>

This serves as a <strong>guide</strong> on launching your github website using Jekyll and Github Pages.<br><br>

### Prerequisites

<br>

### Outline
***

1. [Get started with Github.](#step1)
2. [Find a theme for your Jekyll site.](#step2)
3. [Personalize your Jekyll site.](#step3)
4. [Deploy your site to GitHub pages.](#step4)
5. [Write your first blog post.](#step5)

<br>

### 1. Get started with GitHub.<a name="step1"></a>
***

1. Sign in to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new repository and name it `[username].github.io`, replacing `[username]` with your GitHub username. Be sure the first part of the repo name exactly matches your username and that you set your repository to <strong>public</strong>. Otherwise, it will not work.
<br>
2. Create a `.gitignore` file and add the following line: `_site/`. This file tells `git` to ignore the `_site` directory that Jekyll automatically generates each time a commit is made.
<br>
3. Open your terminal and create a local copy of your website on your computer using the command below.
  ```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/[username].github.io.git
  ``` 
  This way you can always preview your Jekyll site first before pushing it to GitHub pages.

<br>

### 2. Find a theme for your Jekyll site.<a name="step2"></a>
***

1. You can find, preview, and download themes for your Jekyll site on different galleries found online such as the following:
	- [JamStack](https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/jekyll/)
	- [Jekyll Themes dot org](https://jekyllthemes.org)
<br>
2. Once you've chosen a theme, download and extract the file to your local git repository at `~../[username].github.io/`.
	> You can always choose to write your own HTML and CSS [independently](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/convert-site-to-jekyll/). I just find it much more convenient and time-efficient to pick a pre-made theme and personalize it to my liking.
<br>
3. On you local `git` repository, install dependencies for your Jekyll site.
  ```bash
bundle install
  ```
4. Finally, run the server to test your site locally.
  ```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
  ```
  It should be up and running at `http://localhost:4000/`.

<br>

### 3. Personalize your Jekyll site.<a name="step3"></a>
***

1. Your Jekyll site's configuration variables can be found at the file called `config.yml`. You can fill out missing fields or replace unwanted variables completely, and it will look a lot like the code block below.
  ```yaml
# Site Settings
baseurl: ""
url : "https://jennieablog.github.io"
# Blog Settings
theme_settings :
  title : "Jennie Ablog"
  favicon : "assets/favicon.ico"
# Profile Settings
profile :
  image : "assets/img/profile.jpg"
  username : "Jennie Ablog"
  description : "A BSc CS student who loves to teach herself a lot of stuff. üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª"
  ```
2. Once you're already satisfied with the way it looks on your `localhost`, you can proceed to deployment to GitHub Pages.

<br>

### 4. Deploy your site to GitHub Pages.<a name="step4"></a>
***

1. Fire up your terminal and navigate to your local git repository.
    ```bash
git add .
    ```
2. Commit your changes.
    ```bash
git commit -m "initial commit for jekyll site"
    ````
3. Push changes to master branch to deploy your site to GitHub pages.
  ```bash
git push origin master
    ```
4. After a while, you can view your Jekyll Site running at `[username].github.io`.

<br>

### 5. Write your first blog post.<a name="step5"></a>
***

1. Downloaded Jekyll themes usually come with sample blog posts which are located in a folder named `posts/`.
2. Navigate to that folder. You will see files that are likely named in this format `YYYY-MM-DD-sample-blog-post.md`. When you open it it will look something like an `html` file except that it has something else in the beginning.
  ```yaml
---
layout: post
title: title
subtitle : subtitle
tags: [tag1, tag2]
author: 
comments : 
---
  ```
3. What you see in the beginning of the file is called a `yaml` Front Matter block. Between the triple-dashed lines, you can set predefined variables or even define your own. They will then be made available for access using Liquid tags in the file. For more information on Front Matter, visit this [page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/).

4. After writing your blog post, you can `git commit` and `git push` again to the master branch of your `git` repository. Your website shall be updated accordingly.<br><br>

> When in doubt, you can always consult the Jekyll [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), or the `README.md` of the GitHub repository of your chosen Jekyll theme, like [this one](https://github.com/naye0ng/Grape-Theme/blob/master/README.md) or [this one](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo/blob/gh-pages/README.md).
