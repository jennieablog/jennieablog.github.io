<strong>Sign languages are more than just gestures and expressions, they are natural languages with a grammar and lexicon of their own.</strong> There are over 300 sign languages recognized around the world as of today. Sign languages are in so many ways different from other natural languages as they are composed of <strong>signs</strong>⁠— combinations of <strong>manual</strong> elements (hand shape, orientation, movement, etc.) and <strong>non-manual</strong> elements (limbic postures, mouth gestures, facial expressions, etc.). Like any other natural language, sign languages <strong>continue to evolve</strong>. They are constantly being documented and studied in various disciplines. Researchers have devised multiple ways to represent sign languages to study it more closely and make signed content more accessible for both hearing people and the Deaf.<br><br>


<h4>Written Representation of Signs</h4>
Several notiation systems have been developed to enable converting signs into written symbols. Among them are [SignWriting]() and [HamNoSys](). These notation systems have widely been used for sign language studies and are readily available for use in computers. They are visually iconic and have a lot of different symbols to represent both manual and non-manual components of a sign. As a result, these written representations can be quite complex and can become extremely difficult to process for people who are unfamiliar with them.<br><br>


<h4>Signed Content</h4>
 Written representations of sign are not of much use for the Deaf community. For information to be accessible to the Deaf, signed content have now been made available in the form of video. These videos contain sign language equivalents of information that are otherwise spoken or written in a spoken language. Now, many sign language dictionaries can also be found online. These are composed of type-written text and their sign equivalent in the form of videos of humans signing. However, this approach of providing signed content is generally <strong>expensive</strong> to maintain for the following reasons:
 <strong>(1)</strong> a large amount of memory is required on the server side to store signed content, 
 <strong>(2)</strong> bandwidth affects the quality of transmitted signed content which may affect intelligibility of the sign, and
 <strong>(3)</strong> actual humans are needed to sign which is time-and-space consuming.<br><br>

<h4>Synthetic Sign Animations</h4>
Because of the difficulties previously referenced, several alternative solutions have been presented by different studies. One of these is to provide signed content through <strong>synthetic animation</strong>.<br><br>

<h4>A System for Creating HamNoSys-based Dictionaries</h4>
In 2016, Kaur, K. and Kumar, P. proposed a system for creating an HamNoSys-based Indian Sign Language HamNoSys-based dictionary. The proposed system stores sign language data in terms of <strong>sign gloss</strong> and its corresponding <strong>HamNoSys transcription</strong>. From HamNoSys transcriptions, the system generates <strong>SiGML</strong> which is used to produce animation data for a signing avatar.

<h3>Text Representations</h3>
This is useful for many Sign Language-related projects, including my undergraduate thesis, I am currently working on a research project called English2FSL, an automatic translation system for
