<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

<strong>Hello!</strong> I have recently just learned how to create a [Django](https://djangoproject.com) website. And like I always do, I just wrote a fresh guide that anyone can follow whether or not you have had experience with the framework.<br><br>

### Prerequisites
***
- Bash
- Git
- Python (Object-oriented approach)
- Basic HTML and CSS
<br><br>

Listed above are what I think are the prerequisites for this particular guide. I really believe that they are easy to learn. If you're not confident with you're skills with the above items, I suggest going through the following tutorials first: <br><br>

- Bash
- Python
- Basic HTML and CSS

<br>

### Expectations
***
By the end of this guide, you should be able to create a simple blog web app with Django and deploy it using Heroku, which means that you will have <strong>a live blogsite running</strong> if you stick with me towards the end. I tried my best to make this guide as beginner friendly as possible. Also, I didn't want it to be overwhelming so I divided it into three parts which I've outlined below.<br><br>

### Outline
***
[Part 1: Initializing your django application](https://jennieablog.github.io/2020/06/09/django-from-zero.html)

2. Create the django project.
3. Create the blog app.
4. Define the models for the blog app.
5. Create a site administrator.
6. Try using the Django shell.

Part 2: Django URLs, views, and templates

2. Set-up your URLs.
3. Set-up your views.
4. Set-up your templates.
5. Organize your static files.

Part 3: Deploying Django

1. Install and configure heroku.
2. Install prerequisites.
3. Configure static assets and database.
4. Create a heroku app. 
5. Initialize git repository.
