<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

**Hello!** I have recently just learned how to create a [Django](https://djangoproject.com) website. And like I always do, I just wrote a fresh guide that anyone can follow whether or not you have had experience with the framework.<br><br>

### Prerequisites
***
- Bash
- Git
- Python (Object-oriented approach)
- Basic HTML and CSS
<br><br>

Listed above are what I think are the prerequisites for this particular guide. I really believe that they are easy to learn. If you're not confident with your skills with the above items, I suggest going through the following tutorials first: <br><br>

- [An Introduction to the Linux Terminal](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-the-linux-terminal)
- [GitHub Git Cheat Sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/)
- [Python Crash Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-crash-course/)
- [Python Object-oriented Programming](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/object-oriented-programming)
- [Basic HTML and HTML5](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/)
- [CSS in 5 minutes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/get-started-with-css-in-5-minutes-e0804813fc3e/)

### Expectations
***
Using this guide, you should be able to create a simple blog web app with Django and deploy it using Heroku, which means that you will have **a live blogsite running** if you stick with me towards the end. I tried my best to make this guide as beginner friendly as possible. Also, I didn't want it to be overwhelming so I divided it into four parts which I've outlined below.<br><br>

### Outline
***
[Part 1: Initializing your Django application]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/06/09/django-guide-part-1.html)

2. Set-up the URLs and initialize the views.
